To quickly evaluate our system, we offer a server equipped with the necessary hardware, software dependencies, and baseline frameworks. Each directory contains a `run.s`" script that generates the evaluation results on the provided server. If you wish to run these scripts on a different environment, you should update the environment variables within them.
